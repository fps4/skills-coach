# The web image. Build context is the repository root (compose sets `context: ../..`).
#
# As with the api image, the build stage *is* the DoD gate — typecheck, lint, tests and the
# production build. The runtime stage serves the standalone output.
#
# Only `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are build arguments: Next inlines those into the browser bundle, so
# they have to be known at build time. `API_PROXY_TARGET` is deliberately NOT one — it is read at
# runtime by the route handler, so the same image runs against a different api host without a
# rebuild.
