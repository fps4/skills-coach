# The CI image: both packages' dependencies, plus the repository, so the DoD gate can run lint,
# typecheck and the full test suite against a sibling MongoDB container.
#
# The repository is baked in rather than bind-mounted. The CI runner is itself containerized and
# talks to the host Docker socket, so host paths do not translate across it — the build context is
# streamed to the daemon instead.
